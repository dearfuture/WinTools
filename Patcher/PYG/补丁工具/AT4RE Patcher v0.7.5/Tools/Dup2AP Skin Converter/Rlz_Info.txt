27-04-2015:
[+] Added Support for Skin Builder v0.1 B422 and above.
[+] Added External Font name to Skin Header for later use.
[+] Fixed App Crash: When Background, Patch, Exit GFXs are missing.
[+] Fixed few bugs and added some enhancements.

[-] Font is Optional, If no font is selected, Resource Dialog font name will be used.

[!] Skin Builder v0.1 B26 and older versions are no longer supported
    since skin.skn Header has changed (Added Scroll Text Opaque, Font Name..).

[!] Cursor are not supported yet, due to its header is broken,
    and for the lack of documentations about the way how cursor is saved a resources files
    so it will take some time till we can figure out about a solution to fix that.
    "Cursors" is the nastiest thing i ever seen in the whole of that!!

[!] Dup2AP.exe is not Compressed/Packed and should not be or it will not work.

[!] You may wonder what is TmpDLGSnrx.exe?, its a temprary file that converts DLUsToPixels.
    Dialog Unit To Pixels using MapDialogRect function for more info check MSDN: 
    https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms645502%28v=vs.85%29.aspx

    you can delete it after the convertion is finished.
